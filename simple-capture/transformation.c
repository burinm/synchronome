// yuv2rgb - (c) from siewert starter code
// This is probably the most acceptable conversion from camera YUYV to RGB
//
// Wikipedia has a good discussion on the details of various conversions and cites good references:
// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV
//
// Also http://www.fourcc.org/yuv.php
//
// What's not clear without knowing more about the camera in question is how often U & V are sampled compared
// to Y.
//
// E.g. YUV444, which is equivalent to RGB, where both require 3 bytes for each pixel
//      YUV422, which we assume here, where there are 2 bytes for each pixel, with two Y samples for one U & V,
//              or as the name implies, 4Y and 2 UV pairs
//      YUV420, where for every 4 Ys, there is a single UV pair, 1.5 bytes for each pixel or 36 bytes for 24 pixels

void yuv2rgb(int y, int u, int v, unsigned char *r, unsigned char *g, unsigned char *b)
{
   int r1, g1, b1;

   // replaces floating point coefficients
   int c = y-16, d = u - 128, e = v - 128;

   // Conversion that avoids floating point
   r1 = (298 * c           + 409 * e + 128) >> 8;
   g1 = (298 * c - 100 * d - 208 * e + 128) >> 8;
   b1 = (298 * c + 516 * d           + 128) >> 8;

   // Computed values may need clipping.
   if (r1 > 255) r1 = 255;
   if (g1 > 255) g1 = 255;
   if (b1 > 255) b1 = 255;

   if (r1 < 0) r1 = 0;
   if (g1 < 0) g1 = 0;
   if (b1 < 0) b1 = 0;
